I. Introduction

	This will be my working repository. Remnants and tidbits of code I feel are valuable for regurgitation. Most algorithms will not be original and are implementations of those algorithms developed by the "masters" (i.e. historical mathematical geniuses). For those "original" (i.e. scratchbuilt (i.e. uninspired (i.e. non-genius))) algorithms developed by yours truly, please ascribe credit where credit is due.
	This is my toolbox, and as such, almost everything is //TODO. I would not consider this repository as a library or finished product, but as an example of how specific algorithms/tasks may be carried out.
